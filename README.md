# MyFitnessPal
My Fitness Pal is a Java project designed as a mock fitness application. Its primary purpose is to provide an imaginary API that supplies information about foods.

To simulate the API and its responses, the project employs Mockito, a popular mocking framework for Java. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for running unit tests, and information about the mock API.
